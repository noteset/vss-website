In this 3D security agency website, HTML structures the foundational elements of each pageâ€”sections like the header, footer, services, and contact forms. It provides the core layout and basic semantics.

Framer Motion is used to add dynamic animations and transitions, enhancing user engagement. It animates elements as they appear or disappear when navigating between sections, adds hover effects on interactive items, and controls smooth page transitions.

The website runs as a React app, leveraging React-Three-Fiber for 3D components and interactions. Users can explore the website seamlessly, navigating between sections without reloading pages, thanks to React's component-based structure and routing. The integration with Framer Motion makes animations smooth and interactive, adding polish and a modern touch to the user experience.
